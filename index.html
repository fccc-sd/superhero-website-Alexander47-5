<h3> Basic Information </h3>
<p>
The Dark Urge is a playable character in baldur's gate 3 created by Larian Studios who is easily one of the darkest most gruesome characters
but can undergo a redemption arc if the player wishes, which is something I personally choose to do everytime I play the game. 
</p>

<p>
The Dark Urge is an origin character and has a predetermined backstory though unlike the other origin characters they are fully customizable
with the player being able to control the Dark Urge's gender, race, class, appearance, and voice. The default is a white dragonborn, Storm sorcerer
they are are the only character with the unique "Haunted One" background and unlike everybody except shadowheart, the dark urge has amnesia
unable to remember who they are and how they got there, additionally their mind is plagued with voices that tell them to kill or maim or just
be cruel towards everybody leading to tons of unique dialogue for the Dark Urge
</p>

<h3> During the Tutorial </h3>

<p>
In the tutorial the Dark Urge is nearly identical to a regular custom character except that they get a little bit of extra self dialogue
right after character creation and gets advantage when trying to weaken the intellect devourer "Us" with the advantage reason being
called "Split Splatter."
</p>

<h3> Act 1 </h3>

<p>
The first time the Dark Urge interacts with a corpse they get a dialogue where they feel a smile start to creep onto their face, 
to which they can either let it, try to suppress it and being disgusted at themself, or making a check to see if they can remember why
they might be smiling which brings up a scene of the Dark Urge seeing snippets of them standing over hundreds of different dead bodies.
After that they are just a normal character until they either get to the overgrown ruins, the strange rune, or 
talk to any of the possible companions at the overgrown ruins they get 2 unique dialogue options to either convince them
to leave through intimidation or to start combat, At the strange rune, they get a unique option to cut gale's arm off once
it pops out of the rune, and when talking to companions they can choose to either tell them about amnesia or tell
them about the urge to kill that plagues their mind.
