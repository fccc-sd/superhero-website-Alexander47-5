<h3> Basic Information </h3>
<p>
The Dark Urge is a playable character in baldur's gate 3 created by Larian Studios who is easily one of the darkest most gruesome characters
but can undergo a redemption arc if the player wishes, which is something I personally choose to do everytime I play the game. 
</p>

<p>
The Dark Urge is an origin character and has a predetermined backstory though unlike the other origin characters they are fully customizable
with the player being able to control the Dark Urge's gender, race, class, appearance, and voice. The default is a white dragonborn, Storm sorcerer
they are are the only character with the unique "Haunted One" background and unlike everybody except shadowheart, the dark urge has amnesia
unable to remember who they are and how they got there, additionally their mind is plagued with voices that tell them to kill or maim or just
be cruel towards everybody leading to tons of unique dialogue for the Dark Urge
</p>

<h3> During the Tutorial </h3>

<p>
In the tutorial the Dark Urge is nearly identical to a regular custom character except that they get a little bit of extra self dialogue
right after character creation and gets advantage when trying to weaken the intellect devourer "Us" with the advantage reason being
called "Split Splatter."
