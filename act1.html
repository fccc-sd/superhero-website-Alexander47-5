    <h3> After The Nautiloid </h3>

<p>
The first time the Dark Urge interacts with a corpse after the crash they get a dialogue where they feel a smile start to creep onto their face, 
to which they can either let it, try to suppress it and being disgusted at themself, or making a check to see if they can remember why
they might be smiling which brings up a scene of the Dark Urge seeing snippets of them standing over hundreds of different dead bodies.
After that they are just a normal character until they either get to the overgrown ruins, the strange rune, or 
talk to any of the possible companions at the overgrown ruins they get 2 unique dialogue options to either convince them
to leave through intimidation or to start combat, At the strange rune, they get a unique option to cut gale's arm off once
it pops out of the rune, and when talking to companions they can choose to either tell them about amnesia or tell
them about the urge to kill that plagues their mind.

<h3>Meeting Withers</h3>

<p>
After dealing with those looters the Dark Urge can choose to either go a different route or enter the ruin the looters were, well... looting.
Upon entering the ruin there will be a few remnants of the looter group who are checking inside that will turn hostile at your approach.
After going deeper into the ruin and dealing with a group of undead in a large room with a statue, there will be room on the right wall
of the far left outcove, in that room is a coffin, if the coffin is interacted with it will play a cutscene where the coffin opens and a skeleton
hops out, that skeleton is withers and he will ask you "What is the worth of a single mortal life?" the Dark Urge gets 2 unique
options here, the first is to say "Well mine clearly isn't worth much, my blood draws me to violence." and the second I can't remember
exactly but I think it was "Mortal lives are just things to be toyed with." or something along those lines, Withers will be satisfied
with any of the options available and will walk off saying that he will meet the party again "when fate ordains." 
After certain things are done or enough time passes he will show up at the camp and offer ressurection services and mercenaries to hire
but he doesn't do anything special for the Dark Urge yet, he only says "You're wheel turns ever, towards the dark." if the Dark Urge talks to him,
but he is a very important npc in the Dark Urge's redemption route.

<h3>The Emerald Grove</h3>

<p>
After leaving the nautiloid wreck or the ruins the party only has one direction they can continue in, and that is up the path towards the forest.
While traveling the path the party can recruit Lae'zel but this doesn't matter very much to the story I'm talking about, so after recruiting or
killing lae'zel the party goes and arrives at this small hill that 3 paths, one up the hill, another to the left of the hill, and a 3rd to the
right of the hill, if the party get too close to the hill a cutscene will play and start a massive fight between a large group of goblins and a
bunch of tieflings and a handful of humans, if the party deals with the goblins they can enter this fortified druid grove or can walk
down that path that was to the left of the hill which takes them to a bridge with a bunch of dead humans that will take them out of the viscinity
of the grove, if they enter the grove the Dark Urge can access a few npcs that have unique interactions with the Dark Urge, if the party talks to
auntie ethel they can tell her about the amnesia and the call to violence, if they go to the paralyzed woman locked in the warehouse the Dark Urge
can choose to either brutally torture her or resist and spare her, lastly that I'm aware of at least, the party can go into the druids ritual area
where they will be told to meet a woman named kahga who is the temporary leader because Halsin, the actual leader, is missing and kahga is
abusing her power and had caught a tiefling child who tried to steal a small idol of the druids god and when the party gets there kahga
is deciding whether or not to kill the child, the party can convince her which one to do, but if they fail to convince her not to she kills the child, the Dark Urge
gets unique dialogue here to either make gesture for the child to run, which gets her killed on purpse, or to be disgusted with themselves
and not get the child killed.
