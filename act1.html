    <h3> After the nautiloid </h3>

<p>
The first time the Dark Urge interacts with a corpse after the crash they get a dialogue where they feel a smile start to creep onto their face, 
to which they can either let it, try to suppress it and being disgusted at themself, or making a check to see if they can remember why
they might be smiling which brings up a scene of the Dark Urge seeing snippets of them standing over hundreds of different dead bodies.
After that they are just a normal character until they either get to the overgrown ruins, the strange rune, or 
talk to any of the possible companions at the overgrown ruins they get 2 unique dialogue options to either convince them
to leave through intimidation or to start combat, At the strange rune, they get a unique option to cut gale's arm off once
it pops out of the rune, and when talking to companions they can choose to either tell them about amnesia or tell
them about the urge to kill that plagues their mind.
